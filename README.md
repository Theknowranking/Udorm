# Udorm
App for university students. To enable them to stay at other university dorms or at apartments of people living off campus. We could use a system of points so people do not abuse the system and visit more than they receive people. Malachi suggested that this be monetized. We would obviously need to make these stays cheaper than Airbnb and any hotels or motels in the area.
* or have this application work directly with the colleges to make it more official.
